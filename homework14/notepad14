1) selector.addEventListener(eventType, handlerFunction, captureFlag)
before we go to  event listener we need to learn  about DOM html, DOM animations, DOM css, DOM events
The easiest way to modify the content of an HTML element is by using the innerHTML property.
To change the content of an HTML element, use this syntax:
document.getElementById(id).innerHTML = new HTML
This example changes the content of a <p> element:
<html>
<body>

<p id="p1">Hello World!</p>

<script>
document.getElementById("p1").innerHTML = "New text!";
</script>

<p>The paragraph above was changed by a script.</p>

</body>
</html>
