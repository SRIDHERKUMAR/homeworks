ng-repeat vs ng-options:
 ngRepeat can be used on elements instead of ngOptions to achieve a similar result. However, ngOptions provides some benefits, such as more flexibility in how the 's model is assigned via the select as part of the comprehension expression, and additionally in reducing memory and increasing speed by not creating a new scope for each repeated instance.
