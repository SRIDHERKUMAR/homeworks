Shared and Inherited Scope

Shared scope and inherited scope are relatively easier to understand. In a shared scope, directives share the scope with the enclosed controller.

In Isolated scope, the directive does not share a scope with the controller; both directive and controller have their own scope. However, data can be passed to the directive scope in three possible ways.

1.       Data can be passed as a string using the @ string literal
2.       Data can be passed as an object using the = string literal
3.       Data can be passed as a function the & string literal
