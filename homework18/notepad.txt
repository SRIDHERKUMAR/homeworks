Status codes:
  200 (OK) - The Request was successful. For a GET request, the response contains an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

201 (Created) - Returned only for POST requests that create repository items. The request was successful and the repository item was created.


300 Multiple Choice
The request has more than one possible responses. User-agent or user should choose one of them. There is no standardized way to choose one of the responses.
301 Moved Permanently
This response code means that URI of requested resource has been changed. Probably, new URI would be given in the response.
302 Found
This response code means that URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily. New changes in the URI might be made in the future. Therefore, this same URI should be used by the client in future requests.
303 See Other
Server sent this response to directing client to get requested resource to another URI with an GET request.
304 Not Modified
This is used for caching purposes. It is telling to client that response has not been modified. So, client can continue to use same cached version of response.
305 Use Proxy
This means requested response must be accessed by a proxy. This response code is not largely supported because security reasons.
306 unused
This response code is no longer used, it is just reserved currently. It was used in a previous version of the HTTP 1.1 specification.
307 Temporary Redirect
Server sent this response to directing client to get requested resource to another URI with same method that used prior request. This has the same semantic than the 302 Found HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used: if a POST was used in the first request, a POST must be used in the second request.
308 Permanent Redirect
This means that the resource is now permanently located at another URI, specified by the Location: HTTP Response header. This has the same semantics as the 301 Moved Permanently HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used: if a POST was used in the first request, a POST must be used in the second request.
